    <h1>Represent Natural Forces</h1>
    <p>
      I created a continuous snowstorm with velocity, acceleration, and gravity where the user can customize their gravity value through a slider. I referenced existing examples
      on openprocessing.org and applied content from our lecture to implement this. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was trying to exaggerate aspects of a snowstorm by having it release snow in "groups" rather than continuously smooth, and having a slider rather than a text input box 
      allows the user to easily adjust their gravity value.
